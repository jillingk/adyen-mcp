### Usage
To run to the MCP server via `npx` you can execute:

```
npx -y @adyen/mcp --adyenApiKey=YOUR_ADYEN_API_KEY --env=TEST
```

Optionally, if the environment is LIVE then you must also provide your Merchant URL, for example:

```
npx -y @adyen/mcp --adyenApiKey=YOUR_ADYEN_API_KEY --env=LIVE --livePrefix=YOUR_PREFIX_URL
```

We advise to only run a subset of tools required for your particular use case:
```
npx -y @adyen/mcp --adyenApiKey=YOUR_ADYEN_API_KEY --env=TEST --tools=list_all_company_webhooks,list_all_merchant_webhooks
```

**Note:** To run certain functionality (tools) in the mcp-server, you need a webservice user with the following roles: 
* Management API - Accounts Read
* Management API - Payment methods Read
* Checkout Webservice Role
* Merchant PAL Webservice Role
* Management API - Terminals read
* Management API — Assign Terminal
* Management API — Terminal actions read
* Management API — Terminal actions read and write
* Management API — Android files read
* Management API — Terminal settings read
* Management API — Terminal settings read and write
* Management API — Webhooks read

Adyen recommends creating a new webservice user and generating a new API key for the purpose of this application.
Only use the new user’s API key for the MCP application and limit the roles to match the tools you'll be using.
